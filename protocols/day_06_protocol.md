## <span style="color:black"> __Taking Good Notes__ </span>

<span style="color:grey">

* stick to one style, e.g. links are in italic, keywords are in bold, dividers inbetween topics, etc.  
* don't vary your text style too much, keep it simple
* use bold and italic words rarely so they stand out more
